# Cultist-Cleansing-Ritual
A small game made with Bitsy.

A warlock chants the dark song to propitiate his shrouded master for infernal power, but his ritual is interrupted byâ€¦ a Roomba??? Play as a cleaning robot granted free will and infernal cleaning powers, and finally clean this pigsty of a house! The game features vibrant characters, large interactive environments, and a dynamic and responsive gamespace.
